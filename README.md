ARM Linux bootable disks
========================

This is a generic set of scripts that I use to deploy various root
filesystems to my ARMv7 and ARMv8 based boards (Layerscape, Marvell
etc).

There are two scripts.

backup-rootfs.sh
----------------

This takes a rootfs folder tree and packs it inside a gzipped tar
archive. The input folder (passed via the --mount-point argument) can be
a dump of an existing rootfs, a rootfs minimally set up using
debootstrap, a rootfs downloaded from https://archlinuxarm.org/, etc.

mkbootabledisk.sh
-----------------

This takes an input rootfs packed as a gzipped tar archive, plus a
kernel and dtb provided by the user, and creates an image with two
partitions.

- First partition is the "vendor" partition, this is an EFI system
  partition which contains the board-specific stuff: the kernel, the
  dtb, and the means for the bootloader to find what's inside. With
  U-Boot's distro boot system, this means either an extlinux.conf file
  which is auto-generated by this tool, or a user provided U-Boot
  command file.

- Second partition is the "rootfs" partition. This contains an unaltered
  copy of the extracted tarball provided by the user.
